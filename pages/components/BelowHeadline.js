            <p className="lead text-center">Urban Youth is a new not-for-profit youth organisation that will be providing positive and engaging youth work activities, programmes and events, enabling us to build a community of young people and give them the safe space, 
            experiences and opportunities they need to learn, grow and discover themselves and the world around them with positive role models by their side to help guide and nurture them and help them live their lives to the max.

Urban Youth was set up due to the effects of Covid19 and the continuous lockdowns on the health and wellbeing of young people in London.

We are on a mission to create a community of young people, providing positive and engaging youth work activities, programmes and events to help break loneliness and isolation, develop life and social skills and allow young people to be themselves, while giving them the opportunities and experiences to discover themselves and the world around them.</p>
